\textbf {\largeAcademic Honesty Policy Summary:} 

\textbf{Introduction}

\hspace{3mm}
\hangindent=5mm In addition to skills and knowledge, COLLEGE/UNIVERSITY aims to teach students appropriate Ethical and Professional Standards of Conduct. The Academic Honesty Policy exists to inform students and Faculty of their obligations in upholding the highest standards of professional and ethical integrity. All student work is subject to the Academic Honesty Policy. Professional and Academic practice provides guidance about how to properly cite, reference, and attribute the intellectual property of others. Any attempt to deceive a faculty member or to help another student to do so will be considered a violation of this standard.


\textbf{Instructor's Intended Purpose}

\hspace{3mm}
\hangindent=5mm The student's work must match the instructor's intended purpose for an assignment. While the instructor will establish the intent of an assignment, each student must clarify outstanding questions of that intent for a given assignment. 


\textbf{Unauthorized/Excessive Assistance}

\hspace{3mm}
\hangindent=5mm The student may not give or get any unauthorized or excessive assistance in the preparation of any work.

\textbf{Authorship}

\hspace{3mm}
\hangindent=5mm The student must clearly establish authorship of a work. Referenced work must be clearly documented, cited, and attributed, regardless of media or distribution. Even in the case of work licensed as public domain or Copyleft, (See: http://creativecommons.org/) the student must provide attribution of that work in order to uphold the standards of intent and authorship.


\textbf{Declaration}

\hspace{3mm}
\hangindent=5mm Online submission of, or placing one's name on an exam, assignment, or any course document is a statement of academic honor that the student has not received or given inappropriate assistance in completing it and that the student has complied with the Academic Honesty Policy in that work.


\textbf{Consequences}

\hspace{3mm}
\hangindent=5mm  \An instructor may impose a sanction on the student that varies depending upon the instructor's evaluation of the nature and gravity of the offense.  Possible sanctions include but are not limited to, the following: (1) Require the student to redo the assignment; (2) Require the student to complete another assignment; (3) Assign a grade of zero to the assignment; (4) Assign a final grade of ``F'' for the course. A student may appeal these decisions according to the Academic Grievance Procedure. (See the relevant section in the Student Handbook.) Multiple violations of this policy will result in a referral to the Conduct Review Board for possible additional sanctions. \\

The full text of the Academic Honesty Policy is in the \emph{Student Handbook}.
